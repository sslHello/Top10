# Contributing

We encourage anyone to contribute issues, feedback and so on via logging an issue. Once the OWASP Top 10 has been released, 
it might be a while before that feedback is incorporated into the next version (up to 3 years). 

# Translations

If you are interested in translating the OWASP Top 10, please contact @owasptop10 on Twitter - someone else might already be working on 
your language, and you can help that effort instead of doing it over. Generally, we will create a project for you, or you can fork the main 
repo and provide us a pull request once you're done. To maintain traceability, we do ask that you translate the markdown as well, as that's 
what is included in the Wiki version. 

# Forking

You are more than welcome to fork the OWASP Top 10, but please abide by the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license. 

# Pull requests

We welcome pull requests for fixes, but again, it might be a while before we accept any changes to the final version of the OWASP Top 10.
